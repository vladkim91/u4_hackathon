          <h2>To elevate the financial well-being of humanity</h2>
          <p>Our formula was simple: have more cash flowing in every month from our investments than was flowing out in living expenses. In 1994 we simply had $10,000 per month in cash flow coming in every month, primarily from our rental real estate investments, and $3,000 per month going out in living expenses. At that point, thanks to Rich Dad’s principles, we were financially free.
It was at that point that we asked ourselves, “What is it we truly want to do with our lives?”
We believe that the purpose of a business is to solve problems. The problem we set out to solve was that there was little-to-no financial education being taught in the school system…worldwide. So we took on the task to provide real <a href="https://www.richdad.com/financial-education">financial education</a> to people all over the world. We wanted to keep it simple, so that even a 9-year-old could understand it. I was 9 years old when my rich dad began teaching me.

          <h2>Think and Grow Rich has been called the “Granddaddy of All Motivational Literature.”</h2>
          <p>It was the first book to boldly ask, “What makes a winner?” The man who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now counted in the top ranks of the world’s winners himself.
The most famous of all teachers of success spent “a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort” to produce the “Law of Success” philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized in this one.</p>

          <h2>WHAT IS PERSONAL FINANCIAL PLANNING?</h2>
          <p>What is financial planning and why is it so important to your future? At its core, a financial plan is the result of examining your goals and helping you prioritize, save and invest for them. An <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/business/money-management/">effective financial plan</a> will account for <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/ask-tony/how-to-achieve-everything/">achieving goals</a> that are more short-term, such as buying a new home or <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/career-business/are-you-a-wantrapreneur/">starting a business</a>, as well as the long-term goal of retirement. A financial coach or <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/wealth-lifestyle/man-on-the-street-what-is-a-fiduciary/">fiduciary</a> can help you determine the steps in financial planning necessary to reach these goals.</p>
