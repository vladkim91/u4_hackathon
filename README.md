## Introduction
____________

  

CashFlow is a web application that allows user to calculate their monthly financial surplus. It was built using Python3, Django, PostgreSQL, and Vue. Once logged in, users are prompted to add their monthly income and expenses. The app calculates monthly cash flow as well as future projections to encourage users’ to save money. The theme of this app came from Robert Kiyosaki’s best-seller “Rich Dad Poor Dad” book as well as “CashFlow board game”. This simplified version of the game UI tracks and records a history of users’ transactions. The back end was set up with full CRUD.
